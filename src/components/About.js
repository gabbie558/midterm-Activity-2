      <p>Hi! I am Gabriela C. Enriquez. I am currently a student at Pamantasan ng Cabuyao located in Katapatan Homes, Cabuyao, Laguna. I am a 3rd Year student taking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. In my free time i usually watch movies, tv series, anime, and read mangas. In addition, I am still a regular student hehehe. I always manage my time so that I wont be able to miss an activity or a lesson in a course.</p>
